Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio repository! This repository showcases my data science projects and analyses. Below, you'll find information about the first project in this portfolio.

### [Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Food Company Dataset](https://github.com/Ashu70/DataScience_Portfolio/blob/main/MA_EDA.ipynb)

### Overview
In this project, I analyzed the Food Company dataset, which was downloaded from Kaggle. The goal was to gain insights into the dataset and understand the factors affecting campaign acceptance. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, I identified key trends and relationships within the data.

### Key Findings
- I found a positive correlation between campaign acceptance and income, suggesting that customers with higher incomes were more likely to accept the campaign.
- On the other hand, there was a negative correlation between campaign acceptance and the number of dependents, indicating that individuals with fewer dependents were more receptive to the campaign.
- The project involved implementing various EDA techniques to uncover these insights and visualize the data effectively.

### [Project 2: Restaurant's cuisine ratings data EDA Analysis](https://github.com/Ashu70/DataScience_Portfolio/blob/main/Restaurant's_cuisine_ratings_data.ipynb)

### Overview
In this project, I analyzed the Restaurant's cuisine ratings dataset, which was downloaded from Kaggle. The goal was to gain insights into the dataset and understand it. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python.

### Key Findings
- The histogram of the year of birth was negatively skewed which is a common phenomenon in real-world cases which implies that the restaurant gets more younger generation.
- There was a slightly negative correlation between Budget and Service rating but the correlation is weak so we will not put much emphasis on it.
- The Qualitative columns were analysed in ratios which gives a brief idea of the customers the restaurant gets.

### [Project 3: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster ML Implementation(Decision Tree)](https://github.com/Ashu70/DataScience_Portfolio/blob/main/Titanic_Machine_Learning_from_Disaster.ipynb)

### Overview

Certainly! In this well-known Kaggle project, our goal is to analyze the provided datasets and develop a machine-learning model to predict whether individuals survived or not. There are two datasets provided: one for training the model and another for testing its accuracy.

In the testing dataset, a crucial task is to fill in the "Survived" attribute based on the predictions generated by our machine learning model.

In summary, we are working on a project where we aim to:

Analyze the data.
Build a machine learning model for survival prediction.
Use a training dataset to train the model.
Fill in the "Survived" attribute in the testing dataset based on our model's predictions.

### Key Findings/Work done
- Clean the data and calculate the chance of survival based on factor like gender and did some feature reduction too.
- Implemented a Decision tree machine learning algorithm.
- Created a Confusion matrix and calculated accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score (got an accuracy of 74.15%)
- Filled the survival column of Test data with the help of the Decision tree ML model created.


## Future Projects
Stay tuned for more exciting data science projects! I will be adding further analyses and explorations to this portfolio.
