Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio repository! This repository showcases my data science projects and analyses. Below, you'll find information about the first project in this portfolio.

## Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Food Company Dataset

### Overview
In this project, I analyzed the Food Company dataset, which was downloaded from Kaggle. The goal was to gain insights into the dataset and understand the factors affecting campaign acceptance. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, I identified key trends and relationships within the data.

### Key Findings
- I found a positive correlation between campaign acceptance and income, suggesting that customers with higher incomes were more likely to accept the campaign.
- On the other hand, there was a negative correlation between campaign acceptance and the number of dependents, indicating that individuals with fewer dependents were more receptive to the campaign.
- The project involved implementing various EDA techniques to uncover these insights and visualize the data effectively.

## Project 2: Restaurant's cuisine ratings data

### Overview
In this project, I analyzed the Restaurant's cuisine ratings dataset, which was downloaded from Kaggle. The goal was to gain insights into the dataset and understand it. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python.

### Key Findings
- The histogram of the year of birth was negatively skewed which is a common phenomenon in real-world cases which implies that the restaurant gets more younger generation.
- There was a a slightly negative correlation between Budget and Service rating but the correlation is weak so we will not put much emphasis on it.
- The Qualitative columns were analysed in ratios which gives a brief idea of customers the restaurant gets.
